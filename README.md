# Testing controller causes "Invalid Json" when not using route()

This project shows a small set of _JSON posting_ controller tests without using the route() helper, whereupon "Invalid Json" messages are being avoided.

This ideas are based on the suggestions within the following posts on the [play-framework Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/play-framework):
